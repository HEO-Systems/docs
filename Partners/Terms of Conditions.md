# Partner Terms of Conditions

### 1. **Eligibility and Requirements**

To become a **HEO Systems Partner**, you must have a community that aligns with our target audience, such as:
- **YouTubers**
- **Discord Community Owners**
- **Content Creators**
- **Other Community Leaders**

While there are no specific requirements to join, please note that due to the large number of partnership requests at this time, we will not consider small communities for partnership.

---

### 2. **Partner Responsibilities**

As a **HEO Systems Partner**, you are expected to:

#### Promotion of HEO Systems:
- When using any HEO Systems services, you must actively promote HEO Systems. For example:
  - **YouTube**: If you’re creating a video featuring gameplay on a HEO Systems server, include a dedicated promo section where you mention HEO Systems and your unique code (e.g., "Use my code for 10% off every month!").
  - **Discord**: Post about HEO Systems in a highly visible area, such as the server IP channel or any general announcement areas—not just in the partner section where it may go unnoticed. Include your promo code for followers to use for discounts.
  - **Social Media**: Promote our services regularly through your channels, tagging HEO Systems where appropriate, and always highlight your promo code to benefit your community.

By maintaining consistent visibility and sharing your promo code, you help ensure that both you and your followers benefit from the partnership.

### 3. **Prohibited Actions**

As a **HEO Systems Partner**, you must avoid the following actions:

#### Misleading Claims:
- Partners are not allowed to make any misleading or false claims about HEO Systems’ services. We pride ourselves on being honest and transparent about every aspect of our services. Any exaggeration or false information is strictly prohibited.

#### Spamming or Promoting Unrelated Services:
- Spamming affiliate links, irrelevant promotions, or promoting services unrelated to HEO Systems is not allowed. Partners must keep their promotions focused on our services and the benefits for their community.

#### Brand Misuse:
- While you are permitted to use the **HEO Systems** name, logo, and branding, it must always be used responsibly. You must not mislead your community or suggest that HEO Systems endorses something that isn’t true or make false claims about our products or services.

---

### 4. **Termination Clause**

**If the partnership ends gracefully and without any violations, no such penalties will apply.**

HEO Systems reserves the right to terminate any partnership at our discretion, with or without notice. However, termination will typically occur in the following cases:

#### Reasons for Termination:
- **Failure to follow our code of conduct**: For example, making misleading claims, spamming, or promoting unrelated services.
- **Disrespecting warnings**: We may give a warning for violations, but if the partner continues to disregard our terms, the partnership will be terminated without further notice.


!!!danger IMPORTANT NOTE
This only applies if the partnership is terminated! If the partnership ends gracefully and without any violations, no such penalties will apply.
!!!
#### Consequences of Termination:
- **Termination of Services/Servers**: Any services or servers connected to the partner's account will be immediately terminated, with no discussion possible.
- **Loss of Promo Code**: Upon termination, the partner will immediately lose access to the promo code. Ongoing services using the code will still benefit from the discount, but customers will be notified that the partner is no longer affiliated with HEO Systems. The reason for termination may be explained, if necessary.
- **Commission Payout**: Any commission owed to the partner will be paid out. However, if the partner has abused the service, we reserve the right to deduct any losses or damages incurred by HEO Systems from the final commission payout.
- **Impact on Future Partnerships**: If a partner is terminated due to violations, they may not be considered for future partnerships or affiliate programs with HEO Systems.

- Commission varies per partner and is agreed upon at the time of partnership.
- Partners will receive commission on successful sales generated through their promo code, including recurring monthly subscriptions.

#### Commission Timing:
