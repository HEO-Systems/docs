# Why our partner program is better

We're all about building solid partnerships and taking care of our customers. We're not like those other hosting companies, we do things differently here.

## Recurring Payments

At HEO Systems, we believe in rewarding our partners for their efforts consistently. As an HEO Systems Partner, you earn money by bringing new users to our platform who purchase our services. What sets us apart is our commitment to sustained rewards. While other hosting providers offer one-time commission payouts, we go above and beyond by ensuring our partners receive monthly payments for as long as the referred client remains with us.

This remarkable feature demonstrates our dedication to partner success and long-term collaboration. We understand the value of loyalty and retention, and we strive to prioritize ongoing support and rewards for our partners.

## Recurring Discounts for your fanbase

Most hosting companies are stingy with their discounts. For example, they give a measly 20% off for the first month and then BAM! Full price the next month. It's like they're trying to trick people into signing up, and hope that players forget to cancel. We don't do those kind of things at HEO Systems, the discounts we give to partners for their players are recurring. For as long as they are with us, and you will keep getting a commission every cycle.
