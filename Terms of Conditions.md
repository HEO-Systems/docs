After account termination, you will not attempt to register a new account without our permission.

## 6. Payments, Billing and Renewals

On all hosting plans we enforce the following renewal, suspension and termination policy:
- Invoices are typically generated 7 days before the service is due. Once invoiced, a service cannot be upgraded, downgraded, or otherwise adjusted.
- If unpaid, the invoice will be marked as overdue at 11 AM GMT+2 the day after the service is due, and you will be sent a first overdue notice.
- If the service remains unpaid at 11 AM GMT+2 the day after the service is due, it will be suspended and cannot be accessed.
- 24 hours after the invoice was marked as overdue, you will be sent a second overdue notice.
- 48 hours after the invoice was marked as overdue, you will be sent a third overdue notice.
- If the service is not paid after 3 days from the due date, it will be terminated and/or suspended.

### Automatic Billing
- HEO Systems offers automatic billing on our "Stripe" and "PayPal" payment gateways.
- If you have added a payment method to your account when paying an invoice, we will attempt to charge your added payment method on the due date of the invoice, 1 day after the due date, and 2 days after the due date. Should all these attempts fail, you the customer are responsible for ensuring that the invoice has been manually paid to prevent service termination.
- If you wish to disable automatic billing on your account, please open a ticket with our billing team.

## 7. Refunds and Cancellations

Within 2 days (48 hours) of receiving your service, we may be able to offer you a refund back to your original payment method if you are not happy with your service on the following product ranges:
- Minecraft Hosting
- Discord Bot Hosting
- Website Hosting
- SteamCMD Game hosting (Palworld, Project Zomboid)

However, some limitations do apply:
1. Add-ons are non-refundable
2. Dedicated Servers and custom orders are non-refundable
3. A Cancellation request has been processed or submitted on the product
4. A refund has been processed on the account within the last two (2) months
5. The order is an upgrade order
6. If a backup restore has been processed on a service, it is no longer eligible for a refund
7. You caused the downtime
8. You did not want to buy the services
9. You do not receive support
10. Termination based on these and system terms of service
11. Payments made with cryptocurrency can only be refunded to account credit and cannot be refunded back to the original method of payment

Any refunds that we make to the original payment method will have their payment fees deducted from the amount.

We reserve the right to deny refunds at any time depending on the various circumstances.

Other products which are not mentioned above are not covered under the refund policy and are not eligible for a refund.

A ticket must be opened with our Sales department or a cancellation request must be made within 48 hours of service deployment in order to be eligible for a refund. You are required to do this; a cancellation will not be accepted as a refund request.

A refund is sent back to the payment it was made from; we will not issue refunds back to a different payment method than what was originally paid with.

### Reinstatement
- Dedicated servers cannot be reinstated once terminated. Our strict data policy means that terminated servers are wiped and their disks cleared within a few hours of termination.
- Terminated Minecraft, Game and Discord Bot servers may be recoverable after termination, although this will require an active HEO Systems server for the backup to be restored onto that is the same size and pricing or larger than the original service. You can check if this is available for your terminated service via our control panel. HEO Systems makes no guarantee that this option will be available for you.
- All other services once terminated cannot be reinstated; you must purchase a brand-new plan.

## 8. Account Credit

HEO Systems account credit cannot be withdrawn to any form of payment method such as PayPal, Bank transfer, or Cryptocurrency.

Account credit will automatically expire on the 1st of January each calendar year at a rate of 50% of the total credit balance. The minimum credit expiration per year is $25 until the account reaches a balance of $0. If the remaining credit is less than $25, the entire amount will be removed.

To preserve account credit, users must open a ticket during the month of January mentioning their request to preserve the account credit. Doing so will result in no credit being expired for that year.

This policy is in effect to encourage regular use of our services and maintain accurate records. Users are encouraged to monitor their account credit balance to prevent unexpected credit expirations.

Account credit can only be deposited, and our refund policy does not apply to it.

## 9. Affiliate Program

HEO Systems operates an affiliate program whereby clients can refer other clients to HEO Systems in return for credit.

1. Withdrawals from the affiliate program will be for HEO Systems account credit.
2. Monetary processors will not be applicable, therefore PayPal will not be used to pay or exchange the HEO Systems account credit.
3. All promotional, review, and discount sites are not allowed to be used in conjunction with our affiliate system. This includes other media types such as YouTube videos, Facebook videos. If you are unsure, please contact our team for clarification.
4. When posting your affiliate link, it must be in full view and not masked or behind any URL shortener.
5. At any point, we reserve the right to refuse an affiliate payout.
6. Any abuse of the credit affiliated system will lead to the closure of your account and your affiliate earnings being nulled.
7. Certain products such as Dedicated servers do not have an affiliate payout; these products may vary, and HEO Systems reserves the right to modify the affiliate system at any time.

## 10. Service-Specific Terms

### Minecraft Servers
RAM is provided based on the plan ordered. Your server is allocated the full amount of memory you purchase. In-game plugins may not show the service having the full memory; this is due to certain plugins using metaspace.

We provide unlimited slots on all Minecraft plans. This means that you can set your server to any slot number you would like. This does not mean your service can handle unlimited players. CPU-intensive servers may be suspended without warning to prevent causing issues with other clients. You will be notified of this via a ticket on our billing panel and expected to work with us to resolve the issue.

Our disk space is provided as "unmetered" which is in accordance with fair-use. This is based on the node you are on. If your disk space is breaking our fair-use policy, you will be contacted via a ticket on our billing panel and expected to work with us to resolve the issue.

We do not allow the use of automatic backup plugins as these can negatively affect other customers' services by using up a large amount of disk space. For large dynmap folders, logs, backups, and other related files may be purged if they are causing issues on the node.

If you are found to be using a plugin or jarfile that increases your RAM allocation, your service will be terminated without refund. We do not allow the use of plugins that allow you to run multiple servers on the same service, an example of this would be the plugin "subservers."

Servers that have purchased our "Advanced DDoS Mitigation" will have a 1TB soft-limit enforced on their bandwidth per month; this can be raised if deemed necessary by HEO Systems. Please contact our team if you require this to be raised.

By purchasing a Minecraft server from our website, you agree to Mojang's End User License Agreement (http://aka.ms/mc-eula). If your server is found to be in violation of Mojang's EULA, your server may be suspended until you have removed the violating content from your server.

### MySQL Services
We offer 1 free MySQL database with all Minecraft servers. This is an add-on service, and as such, we do not hold any liability for any (paid or free) MySQL data loss or corruption. The MySQL databases associated with your server may only be used for purposes related to your server; any use deemed by HEO Systems outside of this policy will result in the removal of your MySQL database and the data it contains.

The size and storage of your MySQL database is based on fair-usage, although it has a hard limit at 256GB. This does not mean you can always use the full 256GB, as other factors may mean your server exceeds the fair-usage limitation before reaching 256GB in usage. Your server will be suspended if any databases associated with your server exceed this limit.

You may purchase additional databases for your server, limited up to 10 total databases. The terms listed above for the first free database apply to all paid additional databases.

### VPS and VDS
All virtual private servers, no matter the type (VPS or VDS), are subject to a fair use policy.

We try our best to make this as relaxed as possible. There are other virtual machines on your singular host node. This means that you cannot abuse the following resources:
- CPU (VDS can use CPU 24/7)
- Network
- Disk (I/O or IOPS)

Even though a VDS has dedicated CPU, it does not have a dedicated network/port or disk speed. The disk speed and network speed are shared resources which are distributed across virtual machines on the host node. The same goes for VPS, except in the case of a VPS, the CPU cores are also shared. Therefore, if you are "abusing" any of these resources, we may implement caps that will forcefully reduce your usage in order to ensure the stability of our infrastructure.

We deem abuse to be usage that can cause a significant or noticeable impact on other machines, or excessive usage for your plan. For example, if we find that you are continuously using 50% of your CPU 24/7, we may deprioritize your CPU or implement a cap of half of the cores. Usually, this is rare and only done in cases where more CPU is needed for other machines on the node in order to prevent CPU steal.

Another case is bandwidth. For example, if you were to start sustaining 1 Gbps for a bit, we may have to cap you forcefully in order to prevent an impact on other machines. You are allowed to burst the network port to its full capacity, but sustaining it is not allowed.

If you are running high bandwidth use cases, we would suggest not doing it on HEO Systems infrastructure unless a plan explicitly states that there is no FUP. Our unmetered bandwidth is subject to this FUP.

We provide 7 included backup slots with our VPS plans; you agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you perform backups outside of these included backups. We assume no responsibility should these backups not be in a bootable or usable state. It is your responsibility to configure these backups within our control panel to run on a set schedule; by default, they do not run automatically.

If you choose to have a panel preinstalled, we do not guarantee the reliability or availability of the panel installation.

We block SMTP/Email ports (Port 25 and 467) by default; you may open a ticket and provide proof of identity for us to remove the block on these ports should you wish to use them.

### Dedicated Servers
You agree not to engage in any illegal activities on any Dedicated servers within our network. If you choose to have a panel preinstalled, we do not guarantee the reliability or availability of the panel installation. You take full responsibility that if your data is lost due to improper management or backup procedures, we are not responsible. Processes such as OS reinstalls totally wipe the disk on your server, therefore removing all previous data on the server.

While we try to ensure every configuration of every server is in stock, this cannot always be guaranteed; therefore, some models marked as "In Stock" may take longer to provision. In this case, we may offer you alternative configurations which we do have in stock, or alternatively, we will attempt to build the originally ordered configuration within 7 days.

If this 7-day setup period is not met by HEO Systems, you reserve the right to request a full refund of the ordered dedicated server via a support ticket. If no refund request is received, we will continue to build the system until further notice from you. Once the system is "Active" on the HEO Systems billing panel, no refunds will be provided.

In the case a custom agreement is reached with the HEO Systems support team via a ticket, this overrides any of the aforementioned refund/provisioning terms.

Our DDoS Protection is supplied with a soft limit of 10TB of bandwidth per server. This limit may be upgraded for a cost via a ticket with our support team on a case-by-case basis.

Our unmetered bandwidth is offered under "fair usage," and we do not meter (i.e., limit) the bandwidth by default on any of our servers. Customers who use more than 2.5Gbps 95th percentile (inbound or outbound) over all dedicated servers associated with them may be asked to do one of the following:
- Reduce their bandwidth usage
- Split their usage over more dedicated servers
- Pay toward the usage of their bandwidth

If your bandwidth usage on your account is becoming a problem and likely to be outside of fair usage, we will contact you via a billing ticket.

You may subscribe to a commitment period for Dedicated servers in return for a discount on the server's overall monthly pricing. By committing to our dedicated servers for a commitment period of 3, 6, or 12 months, you agree to a binding contract for the full duration of the selected term. During this period, you are not permitted to cancel, request a refund, or downgrade the selected service. Upgrades during this period are permitted as long as the recurring monthly cost is equal to or greater than the existing service.

The commitment period begins on the date of activation of the service and continues for the full term. Commitments will be automatically renewed for the same period again once an existing commitment comes to an end. If you wish to cancel a service or cancel a commitment and move onto monthly billing, you must navigate to our billing panel and press "Cancel Commitment" or "Request cancellation" within the last 21 days of your service term. Requests made outside of this window will not be eligible for early termination.

If you cancel within the final 21 days of your commitment period, no further charges will be applied. If you decide to cancel the commitment period but keep the service, your service will automatically renew at the regular pricing on a month-to-month basis. If you wish to cancel a service before the end of a commitment period, an early termination fee will be applied. This fee will be 50% of the value of the remaining commitment period.

### Web Hosting
We do not allow the hosting of illegal or nulled sites on our Web Hosting. Email spamming is not permitted, and you may be suspended if your account is found to be sending spam emails. Services using nulled or illegal software may be reported via our billing panel using a ticket.

## 11. Backups and Data Loss

We provide offsite backups depending on the level of service. These backups may be taken either daily or hourly and are held on another server which is not accessible by the customer. You may restore or mount backups taken from within our control panel.

If you have not purchased backups on your service but wish to take advantage of existing backups HEO Systems has already taken, there will be a $7.50 restore fee applicable. We suggest that all customers take their own offsite backups in addition to the backups we provide. If backups are not available, HEO Systems may not be held responsible for the loss of files or loss of revenue.

We take offsite backups for all MySQL databases hosted with HEO Systems; these are only accessible from our "Premium" or "Extreme" plans and can be downloaded from within our control panel. "Budget" and other services using MySQL databases with backups may open a billing ticket to pay a $2.50 fee to download these backups.

We are not responsible for any data loss across our services. While we do take our own backups, it is also the customer's responsibility to make sure that their own backups are in place.

## 12. Support Services

We aim to provide a response within 30 minutes for all tickets, although depending on the complexity of the request, this may be longer. Bumping the tickets will further delay a response as we answer tickets based on their last reply. Spamming or flooding our ticket system may result in your ban from our support system, and thus you will not be able to get support.

We reserve the right to not provide support due to, but not limited to, abusive comments such as swearing. If this is a continued problem, your services may be terminated without refund.

We provide a live chat service that is for pre-sales only. If you have any technical queries or billing issues, please create a ticket. All our services are unmanaged unless elsewhere specified; due to this, we are unable to provide extended support for configuration issues.

## 13. Advanced Support Add-ons

You may purchase an "Advanced Support Add-on" for your servers. These add-ons are non-refundable and are provided "as is." These add-ons only apply to the server they were purchased on and can't be moved to another service.

- If we need to remove any files, this will be confirmed with the user beforehand
- We reserve the right to deny any request made for Advanced Support

## 14. Fair Use Policy

All our services operate under a fair use policy. This means that while we offer features like "unlimited slots" or "unmetered disk space," there are reasonable limitations to prevent any single customer from negatively impacting the service quality for others.

Resources such as CPU usage, disk I/O, network bandwidth, and storage space are monitored to ensure equitable distribution among all customers. If your usage consistently exceeds what we deem reasonable for your plan, we may contact you to discuss solutions or ask you to upgrade to a more suitable plan.

## 15. Prohibited Activities

Services found to be abusing may be suspended or terminated without prior warning and refund. Services may be suspended or terminated due to the following reasons (but not limited to):

### Minecraft:
- Persistent excessively high CPU usage
- Excessively large files such as backups or non-service related files
- Attempting to gain unauthorized access
- Circumvention of RAM restriction
- The usage of plugins which have the following functionality: botnet, DDoS, port scanning, backups

### Dedicated Servers, VPS & VDS:
- Using DDoS/DoS scripts or programs and packet flooding
- Hosting or distributing torrents or pirated content
- Attempts to gain unauthorized access to any service other than your own
- Sending spam or unsolicited emails
- Port scanning
- Hosting TOR endpoints (without prior approval)
- Pen testing
- Sharing pirated content

If we receive an abuse complaint, you are required to respond within 48 hours, or your service will be suspended (or terminated after 7 days). If it is clear to our support member(s) that the intent of the server was to commit abuse or other malicious acts, the VPS may be suspended or terminated immediately.

We may charge a fee, such as a $5 IP cleaning fee, if your service was caught abusing or committing malicious acts intentionally. This covers the system administration work involved with delisting IP addresses from spam databases.

Any illegal activity is strictly prohibited on our network and on your services. Some types of activity we prohibit may include:
- Port Scanning
- Brute Forcing
- Sending DDoS or DoS attacks
- IP Spoofing
- Phishing Attacks
- Email Spamming

On our VDS services, using 100% of your CPU 24/7 is allowed.

TOR exit nodes are allowed in certain locations; please contact us first before running one.

Anything against Dutch law or the laws of the country your server is based in is strictly not allowed and is grounds for immediate termination and/or suspension depending on the severity.
