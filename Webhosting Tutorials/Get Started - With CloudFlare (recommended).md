# Get Started - With CloudFlare (recommended)

## Domain
We do not provide domain renting or purchasing services. For domain acquisition, we recommend utilizing platforms like Namecheap. Once you have acquired your domain, you will need to connect it to CloudFlare. If you require assistance with this process, please reach out to the support team of the platform from which you purchased the domain.

## Getting Started with Our Control Panel
Once you have connected your domain with CloudFlare, you can proceed to purchase a web hosting plan from us. If you've already completed this step, fantastic! 

**Navigate to our client area to access the control panel.**
