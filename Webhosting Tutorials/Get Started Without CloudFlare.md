# Get Started - Without CloudFlare

!!! IMPORTANT NOTE
We highly recommend using our web hosting service with CloudFlare. This offers numerous benefits and requires just one additional step.
!!!

## Domain

We do not provide domain renting or purchasing services. For domain acquisition, we recommend utilizing platforms like Namecheap. Once you have acquired your domain, you will need to change its nameservers to ours. If you require assistance with this process, please reach out to the support team of the platform from which you purchased the domain.

**To configure your domain with our nameservers, use the following details:**

- **Nameserver 1:** ns1.heo-systems.net
- **Nameserver 2:** ns2.heo-systems.net

!!!warning Good to know:
Please allow up to 48 hours for the name server changes to take effect. so if the steps do not work for you please take a moment. Should you encounter any further difficulties after this waiting period, please don't hesitate to reach out to us for assistance.
