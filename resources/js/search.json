Our strict data policy means that terminated servers are wiped and their disks cleared within a few hours of termination.","Terminated Minecraft, Game and Discord Bot servers may be recoverable after termination, although this will require an active HEO Systems server for the backup to be restored onto that is the same size and pricing or larger than the original service. You can check if this is available for your terminated service via our control panel. HEO Systems makes no guarantee that this option will be available for you.","All other services once terminated cannot be reinstated; you must purchase a brand-new plan."]},{"l":"8. Account Credit","p":["HEO Systems account credit cannot be withdrawn to any form of payment method such as PayPal, Bank transfer, or Cryptocurrency.","Account credit will automatically expire on the 1st of January each calendar year at a rate of 50% of the total credit balance. The minimum credit expiration per year is $25 until the account reaches a balance of $0. If the remaining credit is less than $25, the entire amount will be removed.","To preserve account credit, users must open a ticket during the month of January mentioning their request to preserve the account credit.

Service-Specific Terms"},{"l":"Minecraft Servers","p":["RAM is provided based on the plan ordered. Your server is allocated the full amount of memory you purchase. In-game plugins may not show the service having the full memory; this is due to certain plugins using metaspace.","We provide unlimited slots on all Minecraft plans. This means that you can set your server to any slot number you would like. This does not mean your service can handle unlimited players. CPU-intensive servers may be suspended without warning to prevent causing issues with other clients. You will be notified of this via a ticket on our billing panel and expected to work with us to resolve the issue.","Our disk space is provided as \"unmetered\" which is in accordance with fair-use. This is based on the node you are on. If your disk space is breaking our fair-use policy, you will be contacted via a ticket on our billing panel and expected to work with us to resolve the issue.","We do not allow the use of automatic backup plugins as these can negatively affect other customers' services by using up a large amount of disk space. For large dynmap folders, logs, backups, and other related files may be purged if they are causing issues on the node.","If you are found to be using a plugin or jarfile that increases your RAM allocation, your service will be terminated without refund. We do not allow the use of plugins that allow you to run multiple servers on the same service, an example of this would be the plugin \"subservers.\"","Servers that have purchased our \"Advanced DDoS Mitigation\" will have a 1TB soft-limit enforced on their bandwidth per month; this can be raised if deemed necessary by HEO Systems. Please contact our team if you require this to be raised.","By purchasing a Minecraft server from our website, you agree to Mojang's End User License Agreement ( http://aka.ms/mc-eula). If your server is found to be in violation of Mojang's EULA, your server may be suspended until you have removed the violating content from your server."]},{"l":"MySQL Services","p":["We offer 1 free MySQL database with all Minecraft servers. This is an add-on service, and as such, we do not hold any liability for any (paid or free) MySQL data loss or corruption. The MySQL databases associated with your server may only be used for purposes related to your server; any use deemed by HEO Systems outside of this policy will result in the removal of your MySQL database and the data it contains.","The size and storage of your MySQL database is based on fair-usage, although it has a hard limit at 256GB. This does not mean you can always use the full 256GB, as other factors may mean your server exceeds the fair-usage limitation before reaching 256GB in usage. Your server will be suspended if any databases associated with your server exceed this limit.","You may purchase additional databases for your server, limited up to 10 total databases. The terms listed above for the first free database apply to all paid additional databases."]},{"l":"VPS and VDS","p":["All virtual private servers, no matter the type (VPS or VDS), are subject to a fair use policy.","We try our best to make this as relaxed as possible. There are other virtual machines on your singular host node. This means that you cannot abuse the following resources:","CPU (VDS can use CPU 24/7)","Network","Disk (I/O or IOPS)","Even though a VDS has dedicated CPU, it does not have a dedicated network/port or disk speed. The disk speed and network speed are shared resources which are distributed across virtual machines on the host node. The same goes for VPS, except in the case of a VPS, the CPU cores are also shared. Therefore, if you are \"abusing\" any of these resources, we may implement caps that will forcefully reduce your usage in order to ensure the stability of our infrastructure.","We deem abuse to be usage that can cause a significant or noticeable impact on other machines, or excessive usage for your plan. For example, if we find that you are continuously using 50% of your CPU 24/7, we may deprioritize your CPU or implement a cap of half of the cores. Usually, this is rare and only done in cases where more CPU is needed for other machines on the node in order to prevent CPU steal.","Another case is bandwidth. For example, if you were to start sustaining 1 Gbps for a bit, we may have to cap you forcefully in order to prevent an impact on other machines. You are allowed to burst the network port to its full capacity, but sustaining it is not allowed.","If you are running high bandwidth use cases, we would suggest not doing it on HEO Systems infrastructure unless a plan explicitly states that there is no FUP. Our unmetered bandwidth is subject to this FUP.","We provide 7 included backup slots with our VPS plans; you agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you perform backups outside of these included backups. We assume no responsibility should these backups not be in a bootable or usable state. It is your responsibility to configure these backups within our control panel to run on a set schedule; by default, they do not run automatically.","If you choose to have a panel preinstalled, we do not guarantee the reliability or availability of the panel installation.","We block SMTP/Email ports (Port 25 and 467) by default; you may open a ticket and provide proof of identity for us to remove the block on these ports should you wish to use them."]},{"l":"Dedicated Servers","p":["You agree not to engage in any illegal activities on any Dedicated servers within our network. If you choose to have a panel preinstalled, we do not guarantee the reliability or availability of the panel installation. You take full responsibility that if your data is lost due to improper management or backup procedures, we are not responsible. Processes such as OS reinstalls totally wipe the disk on your server, therefore removing all previous data on the server.","While we try to ensure every configuration of every server is in stock, this cannot always be guaranteed; therefore, some models marked as \"In Stock\" may take longer to provision. In this case, we may offer you alternative configurations which we do have in stock, or alternatively, we will attempt to build the originally ordered configuration within 7 days.","If this 7-day setup period is not met by HEO Systems, you reserve the right to request a full refund of the ordered dedicated server via a support ticket. If no refund request is received, we will continue to build the system until further notice from you. Once the system is \"Active\" on the HEO Systems billing panel, no refunds will be provided.","In the case a custom agreement is reached with the HEO Systems support team via a ticket, this overrides any of the aforementioned refund/provisioning terms.","Our DDoS Protection is supplied with a soft limit of 10TB of bandwidth per server. This limit may be upgraded for a cost via a ticket with our support team on a case-by-case basis.","Our unmetered bandwidth is offered under \"fair usage,\" and we do not meter (i.e., limit) the bandwidth by default on any of our servers. Customers who use more than 2.5Gbps 95th percentile (inbound or outbound) over all dedicated servers associated with them may be asked to do one of the following:","Reduce their bandwidth usage","Split their usage over more dedicated servers","Pay toward the usage of their bandwidth","If your bandwidth usage on your account is becoming a problem and likely to be outside of fair usage, we will contact you via a billing ticket.","You may subscribe to a commitment period for Dedicated servers in return for a discount on the server's overall monthly pricing. By committing to our dedicated servers for a commitment period of 3, 6, or 12 months, you agree to a binding contract for the full duration of the selected term. During this period, you are not permitted to cancel, request a refund, or downgrade the selected service. Upgrades during this period are permitted as long as the recurring monthly cost is equal to or greater than the existing service.","The commitment period begins on the date of activation of the service and continues for the full term. Commitments will be automatically renewed for the same period again once an existing commitment comes to an end. If you wish to cancel a service or cancel a commitment and move onto monthly billing, you must navigate to our billing panel and press \"Cancel Commitment\" or \"Request cancellation\" within the last 21 days of your service term. Requests made outside of this window will not be eligible for early termination.","If you cancel within the final 21 days of your commitment period, no further charges will be applied. If you decide to cancel the commitment period but keep the service, your service will automatically renew at the regular pricing on a month-to-month basis. If you wish to cancel a service before the end of a commitment period, an early termination fee will be applied. This fee will be 50% of the value of the remaining commitment period."]},{"l":"Web Hosting","p":["We do not allow the hosting of illegal or nulled sites on our Web Hosting. Email spamming is not permitted, and you may be suspended if your account is found to be sending spam emails. Services using nulled or illegal software may be reported via our billing panel using a ticket."]},{"l":"11. Backups and Data Loss","p":["We provide offsite backups depending on the level of service. These backups may be taken either daily or hourly and are held on another server which is not accessible by the customer. You may restore or mount backups taken from within our control panel.","If you have not purchased backups on your service but wish to take advantage of existing backups HEO Systems has already taken, there will be a $7.50 restore fee applicable. We suggest that all customers take their own offsite backups in addition to the backups we provide. If backups are not available, HEO Systems may not be held responsible for the loss of files or loss of revenue.","We take offsite backups for all MySQL databases hosted with HEO Systems; these are only accessible from our \"Premium\" or \"Extreme\" plans and can be downloaded from within our control panel. \"Budget\" and other services using MySQL databases with backups may open a billing ticket to pay a $2.50 fee to download these backups.","We are not responsible for any data loss across our services. While we do take our own backups, it is also the customer's responsibility to make sure that their own backups are in place."]},{"l":"12. Support Services","p":["We aim to provide a response within 30 minutes for all tickets, although depending on the complexity of the request, this may be longer. Bumping the tickets will further delay a response as we answer tickets based on their last reply. Spamming or flooding our ticket system may result in your ban from our support system, and thus you will not be able to get support.","We reserve the right to not provide support due to, but not limited to, abusive comments such as swearing. If this is a continued problem, your services may be terminated without refund.","We provide a live chat service that is for pre-sales only. If you have any technical queries or billing issues, please create a ticket.
