<p>All virtual private servers, no matter the type (VPS or VDS), is subject to a fair use policy.</p>
<p>We try our best to make this as relaxed as possible. There are other virtual machines on your singular host node. This means that you cannot abuse the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU (VDS can use CPU 24/7)</li>
<li>Network</li>
<li>Disk (I/O or IOPS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though a VDS has dedicated CPU, it does not have a dedicated network/port or disk speed. The disk speed and network speed are shared resources which are distributed across virtual machines on the host node. Same goes for VPS, except in the case of a VPS, the CPU cores are also shared. Therefore, if you are “abusing” any of these resources, we may implement caps that will forcefully reduce your usage in order to ensure the stability of our infrastructure.</p>
<p>We deem abuse to be usage that can cause a significant or noticeable impact on other machines, or excessive usage for your plan. For example, if we find that you are continuously using 50% of your CPU 24/7, we may deprioritize your CPU or implement a cap of half of the cores. Usually this is rare, and only done in cases where more CPU is needed for other machines on the node in order to prevent CPU steal. Another case is bandwidth. For example, if you were to start sustaining 1 Gbps for a bit, we may have to cap you forcefully in order to prevent an impact on other machines. You are allowed to burst the network port to its full capacity, but sustaining it is not allowed.</p>
<p>If you are running high bandwidth use cases, we would suggest not doing it on HEO Systems infrastructure unless a plan explicitly states that there is no FUP. Our unmetered bandwidth are subject to this FUP.</p>

<p>If we receive an abuse complaint, you are required to respond within 48 hours or your service will be suspended (or terminated after 7 days). If it is clear to our support member(s) that the intent of the server was to commit abuse or other malicious acts, the VPS may be suspended or terminated immediately. We may charge a fee, such as a $5 IP cleaning fee, if your service was caught abusing or committing malicious acts intentionally. This covers the system administration work involved with delisting IP addresses from spam databases.</p>
<p>Any illegal activity is strictly prohibited on our network and on your services. Some types of activity we prohibit may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Port Scanning</li>
<li>Brute Forcing</li>
<li>Sending DDoS or DoS attacks</li>
<li>IP Spoofing</li>
<li>Phishing Attacks</li>
<li>Email Spamming</li>
</ul>
<p>On our VDS services, using 100% of your CPU 24/7 is allowed.</p>
<p>TOR exit nodes are allowed in certain locations, please contact us first before running one.</p>
<p>Anything against Dutch law or the laws of the country your server is based in is strictly not allowed and is grounds for immediate termination and/or suspension depending on the severity.</p>
